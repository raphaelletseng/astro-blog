# About

Hi, I'm Raph.
I develop software to help [monitor greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.ghgsat.com/) when I'm not running around outside & climbing rocks.

I graduated from McGill University, where I studied mathematics and computer science. Since then, I've worked in business and technology consulting, been part of the [AI4Good Lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/), and volunteered for organisations like [Future Earth](https://futureearth.org/), [Sustainability in the Digital Age](https://sustainabilitydigitalage.org/), and [Earth Hero](https://www.earthhero.org/).

I enjoy writing code and working on projects that support social impact and the mitigation of climate change.
